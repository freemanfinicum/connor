# Happy Birthday Connor...

Dear Connor,
I remember so well when you were born. It was the Best day of my life.  I have never quite had a feeling like that, it was like pure contentment, completion and joy.  With your birth, I got to be the loving father and you would become the loving son.  Your mom was so happy with you, she kept you so close to her all the time, never letting you go for long.  Of course I am eternally grateful to your beautiful and loving mom.  You grew up to give me everything I could ever want in a son; heart, courage and love.  I will never forget the way you played basketball and played your heart out and all I could do was cheer you on.  I could go on and on and on forever.  We are intertwined for eternity and I was always aware that you get to walk the Connor walk and I get to allow you to develop as only your immortal spirit will be.  I am always looking for you in my dream-visions.  I know that my dream-visions are a peak into other realms that you may be experiencing now.  I am eternally grateful that you chose me to be your father and I take ownership of that.  I will always be here for you and continue on everything you were about.  Visit me in my Dream-visions tonight...

Your loving father...
