### This is what's REAL in my life...


1.  Who are the RATS...  Reptilian Alien TaplinerS-  
2.  What are they up to...  Taplining-  Kontrolling you in every which way.
3.  Results...  FEAR, Confusion, Depression and Cognitive Disonance resulting in dehabilition of you physical body. 
4.  Solution...  Grounding yourself. Coming to a place of no-mind. Neutral, letting go of attachment's aka Taplines. Interruption of Taplines via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XGDHayyECU" target="_blank">sounds of NU-U-U-U...</a> 
5.  Possibilities...  REcognizing your personal Sovereignty.  Taking full, complete and total Authority and Responsibility over your Immortal Spirit. Getting off the wheel of re-incartion for another Kontrolled lifetime until you "get it". Transcending this Cause-and-Effect creation. Developing an Awareness of REAL UNIverses with No Restrictions and allowing it to unfold...   


___Taplining aka Agreement to this or that.  Which interrupts your ability to just BE. I notice how nature BE's all around me.  What I get is; animals and nature don't create stuff to deal with.  They don't create Happiness, Depression, Politics, Religion ect... They reside in pure Awareness.  They just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evht41pyNGU/" target=" blank">BE</a>...  It's a beautiful thing...___
